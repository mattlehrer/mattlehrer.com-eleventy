I've seen the movie a few times and had a general sense that I wanted to read this book as it was recommended in a few places. Then [Chuck Yeager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Yeager) died and William Zinsser recommended Wolfe and The Right Stuff specifically in [On Writing Well](https://bookshop.org/books/on-writing-well-the-classic-guide-to-writing-nonfiction-anniversary/9780060891541) and I moved it up my list.

It's a great story about what it means to be a hero and to represent a country, covering the beginning of the space age in the face of the Cold War. It filled in a lot of gaps and history with some of the same people from [Rocket Men](https://bookshop.org/books/rocket-men-the-daring-odyssey-of-apollo-8-and-the-astronauts-who-made-man-s-first-journey-to-the-moon/9780812988710), which is about Apollo 8.

There are lots of moments that prove Zinsser's point that Wolfe is a master of nonfiction storytelling. One thing that really stood out to me – especially after thinking that Trump ruined it – was his use of the exclamation point. The key is that he uses it throughout entire paragraphs to control the pace and get you really into someone's head. It's masterful.

> On the one hand, they hated the process. It meant talking to reporters and other fruit flies who always hovered, eager for the juice … and invariably got the facts screwed up … But that wasn’t really the problem, was it! The real problem was that reporters violated the invisible walls of the fraternity. They blurted out questions and spoke boorish words about … all the unspoken things!—about fear and bravery (they would say the words!) and how you felt at such-and-such a moment! It was obscene!

I recommend both the book and the movie.
