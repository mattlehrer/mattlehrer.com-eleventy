Great, short read. It's not what I expected when I had seen it recommended. I thought it was going to be about how to adjust your strategy in business. It's not that at all. The point is how to be a better person, and it has some great advice. 

One of the easiest pieces of advice to implement is to say "thank you" instead of getting defensive.
